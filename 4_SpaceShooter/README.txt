This is a (kinda) incomplete game that resembles a basic space shooter. It's original purpose was to act as a
"showoff" game for the SHS GD club. It contains explosions and some nice camera shakes. enemies.py and swarm_generator.py
are incomplete as of this moment. When u start the game, 3 swarms of basic enemies will come at you. If you kill them all,
you win.You can easily mod swarm_generator to have more swarms or have them in different configurations.
Change main.py's Game class's number_of_waves variable to be the number of waves you want. In enemies.py, more enemies can be defined.
